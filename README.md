# Arduino MIDI filter

This is very simple midi filter for arduino UNO (will probably work with others).

The program has two modes: 
  1. Whitelist: Deny everything except allowed messages.
  2. Blacklist: Allow everything except allowed messages.

To configure just set to 1 the messages that you want to filter in/out.

This project was made using [this great post](https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/2020/09/12/arduino-midi-filter/) as reference.
